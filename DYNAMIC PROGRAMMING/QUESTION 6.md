<h2>Arithmetic Slices </h2>
An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 

Example :

>Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
>
>Output: 3
>
>Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
