# 🎯More on OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION:

- Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. It’s usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. 
- Although the main point of  open source projects is to create valuable and accessible open source software, individual contributors can get plenty of personal benefit from contributing to them. 
- By collaborating with others on open source you use, you get to become part of a community where you can practice your soft skills like communication, giving and receiving feedback, emotional intelligence, etc.
