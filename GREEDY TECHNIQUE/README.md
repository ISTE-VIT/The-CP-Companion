# What is a 'Greedy algorithm'? :moneybag:

> A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

# :thinking:How do you decide which choice is optimal?

> Assume that you have an objective function that needs to be optimized (either maximized or minimized) at a given point. A Greedy algorithm makes greedy choices at each step to ensure that the objective function is optimized. The Greedy algorithm has only one shot to compute the optimal solution so that it never goes back and reverses the decision.

# :pencil:How to create a Greedy Algorithm?

**Sonuds a bit muddled right ? Don't worry we got you !**

- Let's say that you enter a sports shop where there are four items that you like. The prices of these are also given to you. Assume today is your birthday and your father has given you $250 to spend. Now you like all the items there. So we need to device an algorithm that tells him the maximum number of items that he can buy with the given amount.

- This situation may seem very ordinary, but this indeed explains the core concept of greedy algorithms. What will you do in this situation ? You will start selecting items in the incresing order of their prices till the overall price overshoots the total amount that is given to us. That is exactly how we approach this problem.

**But wait, how will it come under a greedy solution ?**

- To explain this, we need to understand why are we taking the items in the increasing order of their prices. We are doing this because, we think that chooseing the item with lowest price first, will enable us to take more number of items at the end.

> The idea that we take the item that has the least price at that time is nothing but choosing the choice that is optimal locally, and by doing this, we have a solution for the overal problem if we contiue doing this optimal choice until the total amount overshoots the amount that is given to us.

**Here is a vibrant illustration on this context,**
